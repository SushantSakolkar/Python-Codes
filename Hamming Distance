# The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

# Output
class Solution(object):
    def hammingDistance(self, x, y):
        return bin(x^y).count

# Exor (^) returns 1 if bits are diffrent.
# To count # of 1s in integer : bin(n).count("1")
